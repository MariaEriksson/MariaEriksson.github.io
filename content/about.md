I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada), funded by the [Sigrid Jus√©lius Stiftelse](https://www.sigridjuselius.fi/en/). My work focuses on clinical and cognitive outcomes after epilepsy surgery in children. 

I obtained my PhD at [UCL Institute of Child Health](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/research/developmental-neurosciences) and [Great Ormond Street Hospital](https://www.gosh.nhs.uk), under the supervision of [Professor Torsten Baldeweg](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/people/torsten-baldeweg), [Professor Helen Cross](https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/our-people/staff-z/helen-cross/), and [Mr Martin Tisdall](https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/our-people/staff-z/martin-tisdall/). My PhD was funded by [NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre](https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/our-research/our-research-infrastructure/nihr-great-ormond-street-hospital-brc/) as part of the [UCL Child Health Research PhD Programme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/child-health-research-phd-studentships-202223).

In October 2020, I was awarded the [UCL Research Scholarship for Cross-Disciplinary Training](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/graduate-research-scholarships-cross-disciplinary-training-one-year) to undertake an additional year of training at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk), the UK's national institute for data science and machine learning. Here, under the supervision of [Dr Kirstie Whitaker](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/kirstie-whitaker), I learnt how to apply an open and reproducible science approach to clinical research.
