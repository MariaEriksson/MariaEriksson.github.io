I am a PhD student based jointly at [UCL Institute of Child Health](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/research/developmental-neurosciences) and [Great Ormond Street Hospital](https://www.gosh.nhs.uk). I am supervised by [Professor Torsten Baldeweg](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/people/torsten-baldeweg) and [Professor Helen Cross](https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/our-people/staff-z/helen-cross/). My PhD is funded by [NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre](https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/our-research/our-research-infrastructure/nihr-great-ormond-street-hospital-brc/) as part of the [UCL Child Health Research PhD Programme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/study/postgraduate-research-programmes/child-health-research-phd-programme).



My research aims to predict clinical and cognitive outcomes after paediatric epilepsy surgery to guide surgical candidate selection, inform post-surgical rehabilitation, and provide family counselling. I use large sets of electronic medical records and neuroimaging data, alongside data science and machine learning, to achieve a precision-medicine approach for children with epilepsy.



In October 2020, I was awarded the [UCL Research Scholarship for Cross-Disciplinary Training](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/graduate-research-scholarships-cross-disciplinary-training-one-year) to undertake an additional year of training at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk), the UK's national institute for data science and machine learning. Here, under the supervision of [Dr Kirstie Whitaker](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/kirstie-whitaker), I am learning how to apply an open and reproducible science approach to clinical research.
